## Steps & Skills Demonstrated

### 1. **Virtual Machine Setup**
- Used **VMware Workstation Pro** to create an isolated virtual environment.
- Allocated system resources (CPU, RAM, disk) and configured network settings for optimal performance.

---

### 2. **Kali Linux Installation**
- Downloaded the official **Kali Linux ISO**.
- Installed Kali Linux as the guest OS in the VM.
- Performed basic system configuration and updates for security and usability.

### 3. **Wireshark Installation & Fundamentals**
- Installed Wireshark on Kali Linux using the terminal:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install wireshark
  ```
- Configured Wireshark to capture live network traffic within the VM.

### 4. **Packet Capture & Analysis**
- Captured live network packets from various interfaces.
- Utilized Wireshark‚Äôs filtering capabilities to:
  - Identify specific protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
  - Locate source and destination IP addresses.
  - Examine packet details and payloads.

### 5. **Filtering & Managing Data**
- Applied display filters to isolate traffic types and sources, such as:
  - `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` for specific IP addresses
  - `tcp.port == 443` for HTTPS traffic
  - `http` for web traffic
- Learned to export packet captures for further analysis and reporting.
